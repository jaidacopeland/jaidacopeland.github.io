        <h2>New Zealand: Christchurch, Wellington & Kaikoura</h2>

        <div class="experience-text">
            <p>During my trip to New Zealand, I explored the rich intersections of sustainability, culture, and governance. In Christchurch and Wellington, we met with sustainability leaders at Kathmandu’s headquarters to understand how their action plan integrates environmental and social goals across operations.</p>
            <p>One of the most impactful stops was at Parliament in Wellington, where we learned about New Zealand's commitment to climate legislation and democratic transparency. We also explored the potential of WikiHouses—digitally fabricated homes designed for accessibility, low environmental impact, and community empowerment. These structures address the four pillars of sustainability: social, environmental, economic, and political.</p>

        <h2>Australia: Cairns & Sydney</h2>

        <div class="experience-text">
            <p>Australia offered a deep dive into biodiversity, Indigenous culture, and environmental innovation. I visited the ancient Daintree Rainforest and Kuranda Village, learning from local guides about conservation efforts and land stewardship. In Sydney, we engaged in conversations about urban sustainability and climate adaptation in coastal cities.</p>
            <p>One of the most unforgettable moments was snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef, where I witnessed firsthand both the beauty of marine ecosystems and the threats posed by coral bleaching. We also visited the Skybury Café, a sustainable, net-zero coffee producer that exemplifies how small businesses can lead in environmental responsibility.</p>

        <h2>Belize: Bella Vista</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="experience-text">
            <p>Through a mission trip to Bella Vista, I was able to connect deeply with a local community. We spent the week hosting Vacation Bible School at a local church, engaging children in meaningful and joyful programming. Beyond that, we organized a clothing donation drive and distributed food supplies to families in need.</p>
            <p>This experience reshaped the way I think about service, reminding me that sustainability also includes community care, equity, and empathy. I learned how impactful small-scale efforts can be when paired with intention and collaboration. It solidified my interest in pairing grassroots engagement with systemic sustainability change.</p>
