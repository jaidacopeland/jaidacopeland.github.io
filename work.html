        <h2>Sustainability in the Workplace Intern</h2>
        <p><strong>Organization:</strong> Penn State University</p>
        <p>As part of Penn Stateâ€™s Sustainability Institute, I helped shape the Green Paws Program, a self-paced certification for staff and faculty looking to embed sustainability into their offices. I was responsible for designing new module content, which included curated readings, reflection questions, and suggested actions. I also supported SustainaLions, the university's sustainability-focused Employee Resource Group, which has grown to over 97 members across campus.</p>

        <h2>Sustainable Lab Consultant</h2>
        <p><strong>Organization:</strong> Penn State University</p>
        <p>In my role as a Sustainable Lab Consultant, I conducted environmental audits and tracked energy use in an active university research lab. Our team focused on modifying standard operating procedures to reduce waste, conserve resources, and encourage behavior change. I helped install aerators to cut water usage and implemented power-down protocols that significantly lowered lab energy consumption. These strategies helped raise our labâ€™s sustainability score from 40% to 80% in under a year.</p>

        <h2>Markets Institute Business Case Intern</h2>
        <p><strong>Organization:</strong> World Wildlife Fund (WWF)</p>
        <p>At WWFâ€™s Markets Institute, I contributed to strategic business case development on topics like <strong>pre-competitive knowledge sharing</strong>â€”a sustainability approach that encourages collaboration across industries to solve global environmental challenges. I also conducted detailed research on social media performance and audience behavior, and my insights directly informed the planning of future content across WWFâ€™s digital platforms. My work supported both the communications team and internal leadership through data-driven storytelling and stakeholder-focused deliverables.</p>
