            <img src="assets/skybury.jpg" alt="Skybury Coffee">
            <p>During my Penn State Maymester in Australia, I explored the Kuranda village located in the world's oldest tropical rainforest. This opportunity allowed me to appreciate the depth of ecological history and local culture. I also visited the Skybury Café, a sustainable coffee producer operating at net zero—offering firsthand insight into sustainable agricultural practices. Additionally, I snorkeled in the Great Barrier Reef and learned about active restoration efforts addressing coral bleaching, which deepened my understanding of the urgency and innovation within marine conservation.</p>

            <h2>New Zealand – Kaikoura, Parliament, Kathmandu HQ</h2>
            <img src="assets/new-zealand.jpg" alt="Kaikoura Snorkeling">
            <p>In New Zealand, we explored sustainability from corporate, civic, and community-driven perspectives. We visited Kathmandu’s central headquarters to learn about their sustainability action plan and brand integration. At Parliament, we studied the country's democratic framework, gaining political and cultural context. A hands-on highlight was our visit to a WikiHouse lab, where we discovered how modular homes can offer sustainable housing solutions aligned with all four pillars of sustainability: social, environmental, economic, and political. Each experience built on the next, connecting systems thinking to on-the-ground action.</p>

            <h2>Belize – Bella Vista (Mission Trip)</h2>
            <img src="assets/belize.jpg" alt="Belize Mission Trip">
            <p>In Bella Vista, I participated in a service-based mission trip hosted by Praying Pelican Missions. We partnered with a local log church to host Vacation Bible School for children throughout the week. Beyond educational programming, we organized a clothing donation drive and distributed non-perishable food packages to families in need. This experience taught me the power of grassroots outreach and the impact of community-centered support systems—reminding me that sustainability also includes social and humanitarian care.</p>
